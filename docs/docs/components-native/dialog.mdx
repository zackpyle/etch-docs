# Dialog

The **Dialog** element (also known as Modal) is a UI component that overlays content on top of the page, requiring user interaction before returning to the parent interface. Dialogs are typically used for tasks such as:

- Displaying alerts or confirmations
- Collecting input (forms, fields)
- Showing additional details without navigating away

Dialogs in Etch are implemented as components with accessible markup and managed focus. The dialog remains hidden until triggered (for example, by a button or another user interaction). When visible, it captures focus and disables interaction with the background content (often by using an overlay).

**Key features of the Dialog element:**

- Can be opened and closed programmatically or by user action
- Supports keyboard accessibility (including focus trap and Escape key to close)
- Content is added inside a dedicated `dialogcontent` slot, allowing for flexible composition (text, images, forms, etc.)
- Includes an overlay to dim the rest of the page and focus attention on the dialog
- Fully customizable: you can edit styles, structure, and triggers within Etch

In Etch, use the Dialog when you want to present important information or gather information from the user, while temporarily interrupting the main workflow in a focused manner.


## Setup

- Add a container or a flex-div on your site if you don't already have one.
- You'll paste the Dialog component into the container or flex-div in the next step.

## Importing the Component

Use the button below to copy the ready-to-use Dialog component as JSON.
Then, in Etch, press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Windows) anywhere in the builder to insert the component.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
  <CopyToClipboard label="Copy Dialog Component" value={MODAL_JSON} />
</div>

### Steps
- Click "Copy Dialog Component" above, then in Etch press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Mac) / <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Windows) anywhere in the builder to insert the component
- Arrange the component inside your container or flex-div.
- Verify the component.

### Configuration
- CSS, JS, and props are bundled inside the component—no setup required. You can edit prop values to customize behavior.
- Styling: tweak CSS variables on `.etch-modal` (e.g., colors, icon sizes).
- Fill the props in the Elements Settings panel.


## Editing the Dialog

Dialog comes with 1 slot, if you open the dialog and you don't see the slot, you will need to add it.

### Adding the slot ( if the slot is not already there )

Once you select the dialog, on the bottom bar where all the elements are, you will see 1 slot icons on the left, click on it and you should see the slot appear on the dialog.

Now your dialog should contain 1 slot named `dialogcontent`

### Adding content to the slot
- You can add content to the dialog by adding content to the slot.
- `dialogcontent` slot is the content that will be displayed in the dialog.
  - You can add any content to the slot.
  - You can add text, images, create cards, use divs, the slot is a normal div container.

:::tip
You can edit the content while the dialog is open by adding Switching (Show / Hide Editor).

### Adding a trigger to the dialog

Lets select the dialog component and see the Elements Settings panel.

On that Panel there will be a prop called `triggerSelector`, type there a .class or an #id from the element that you want to trigger the dialog from.
