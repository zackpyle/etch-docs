# Off Canvas

:::note
This page documents the recommended way to add an Off Canvas (Drawer) by importing the prebuilt component with Copy/Paste JSON below.
:::

## Setup

- Add a container on your site if you don't already have one.
- You'll paste the Off Canvas component into the container in the next step.

## Importing the Component

Use the button below to copy the ready-to-use Off Canvas component as JSON.
Then, in Etch, press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Windows) anywhere in the builder to insert the component.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
  <CopyToClipboard label="Copy Off Canvas Component" value={DRAWER_JSON} />
</div>

### Steps
- Click "Copy Off Canvas Component" above, then in Etch press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Mac) / <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Windows) anywhere in the builder to insert the component
- Arrange the component inside your container.
- Verify the component.

### Configuration
- CSS, JS, and props are bundled inside the component—no setup required. You can edit prop values to customize behavior.
- Styling: tweak CSS variables on `.etch-drawer` (e.g., colors, icon sizes).
- Fill the props in the Elements Settings panel.


## Editing the Off Canvas

Off Canvas comes with 1 slot, if you open the drawer and you don't see the slot, you will need to add it.

### Adding the slot ( if the slot is not already there )

Once you select the drawer, on the bottom bar where all the elements are, you will see 1 slot icons on the left, click on it and you should see the slot appear on the drawer.

Now your drawer should contain 1 slot named `drawerContent`

### Adding content to the slot
- You can add content to the drawer by adding content to the slot.
- `drawerContent` slot is the content that will be displayed in the drawer.
  - You can add any content to the slot.
  - You can add text, images, create cards, use divs, the slot is a normal div container.

:::tip
You can edit the content while the drawer is open by adding Switching (Show / Hide Editor).
:::

### Adding a trigger to the drawer

Lets select the drawer component and see the Elements Settings panel.

On that Panel there will be a prop called `triggerSelector`, type there a .class or an #id from the element that you want to trigger the drawer from.
