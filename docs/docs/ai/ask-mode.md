# Ask Mode

Ask Mode is the default AI mode in Etch. It's a conversational assistant you can use to ask questions about Etch, web development, and how to accomplish things.

## What You Can Ask

- **Etch-specific questions** — How do I create a component? How do loops work? How do I use conditional logic?
- **Web development questions** — CSS layout techniques, HTML semantics, JavaScript concepts, accessibility best practices
- **How-to guidance** — Step-by-step help for building specific layouts, patterns, or features
- **Troubleshooting** — Why something isn't working the way you expect

Ask Mode provides answers and working code that you can copy and paste directly into Etch — whether that's HTML structures, CSS, or dynamic data expressions.

## Using Ask Mode

1. Open the AI panel in the builder
2. Type your question in the chat input
3. The AI will respond with an explanation, code snippets, or step-by-step guidance

You can ask follow-up questions to refine the answer or dig deeper into a topic.
