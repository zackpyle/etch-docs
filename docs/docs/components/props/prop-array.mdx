# Loop Prop 

The Loop Prop creates an internal loop reference. It's useful for when you're including a loop inside your component and need to be able to choose the Loop Source when adding your component to a page.

Since components might be used on multiple sites, or with different loops at different times, you might want to build a loopable structure inside your component without creating a fixed reference to any specific loop. The Loop Prop allows you to select the loop that should run inside the component when you're using the component.

Here's the difference between a typical loop and a prop-based loop:

### Typical Loop

```html
{#loop someLoop as item}{/loop}
```

### Prop-Based Loop

```html
{#loop props.yourLoopProp as item}{/loop}
```



:::info
Props are typically referenced with `{}` brackets. However, when you're already working within bracketed data, you should not use another set of brackets.

Loop prop keys must be camelCased or use bracket notation (they cannot be dash-cased).

**Incorrect:** `{#loop {props.yourLoopProp} as item}{/loop}` (extra brackets)

**Incorrect:** `{#loop props.your-loop-prop as item}{/loop}` (dash-cased key)

**Correct:** `{#loop props.yourLoopProp as item}{/loop}` (camelCase)

**Correct:** `{#loop props['your-loop-prop'] as item}{/loop}` (bracket notation)

## Loop Props with Loop Arguments

<VersionBadge version="1.0.0-beta-10" />

You can combine loop props with [loop arguments](/loops/loop-arguments) to create even more flexible, reusable components. This allows you to pass both the loop source AND argument values through component props.

### Basic Structure

When using a loop prop that accepts arguments, you can pass prop values as the argument values:

```html
{#loop props.myLoop($count: props.myCount) as item}
  <!-- loop content -->
{/loop}
```

In this example:
- `props.myLoop` is a Loop Prop that defines which loop to use
- `props.myCount` is a regular prop (text or number type) that provides the value for the `$count` argument

### Complete Example

Here's a complete component that uses both a loop prop and a count prop:

```html
<component>
  <div>
    {#loop props.myLoop($count: props.myCount) as item}
      <article>
        <h2>{item.title}</h2>
        <p>{item.excerpt}</p>
      </article>
    {/loop}
  </div>
</component>
```

**Component Props Setup:**
- Create a **Loop Prop** named `myLoop` to select the loop source
- Create a **Text Prop** named `myCount` with a default value (e.g., `3`)

When using this component, you can:
1. Select any compatible loop for the `myLoop` prop
2. Set the number of items to display via the `myCount` prop

This pattern works with any loop argument - not just `$count`. You can pass multiple prop values to multiple loop arguments as needed.

## Using Modifiers with Loop Props

Loop props and argument props can be combined with [dynamic data modifiers](/dynamic-data/dynamic-data-modifiers/basic-modifiers) for even more flexibility and control.

### Modifiers on Loop Props

You can apply modifiers directly to the loop prop itself. For example, using `.slice()` to limit the number of items:

```html
{#loop props.myLoop.slice(0, 3) as item}
  <article>
    <h2>{item.title}</h2>
  </article>
{/loop}
```

This would display only the first 3 items from the selected loop, regardless of how many items the loop source contains.

### Modifiers on Argument Props

You can also apply modifiers to props used as loop arguments. This is especially useful for ensuring data types are correct:

```html
{#loop props.myLoop($count: props.myCount.toInt()) as item}
  <!-- loop content -->
{/loop}
```

In this example, `.toInt()` ensures that the `myCount` prop value is converted to an integer before being passed to the loop argument.

### Combining Bracket Notation with Modifiers

When using bracket notation for dash-cased prop names, you can still apply modifiers:

```html
{#loop props['my-loop'].slice(0, 5) as item}
  <!-- loop content -->
{/loop}
```

Or on argument props:

```html
{#loop props.myLoop($count: props['my-count'].toInt()) as item}
  <!-- loop content -->
{/loop}
```

### Complete Example with Modifiers

Here's a comprehensive example combining multiple techniques:

```html
<component>
  <div>
    {#loop props['featured-loop'].slice(0, props.maxItems.toInt())($offset: props.startFrom.toInt()) as item}
      <article>
        <h2>{item.title}</h2>
        <p>{item.excerpt.truncateWords(20)}</p>
      </article>
    {/loop}
  </div>
</component>
```

This example demonstrates:
- Bracket notation for a dash-cased loop prop (`props['featured-loop']`)
- `.slice()` modifier on the loop prop using a prop value with `.toInt()`
- An `$offset` argument with a prop value using `.toInt()`
- A modifier (`.truncateWords()`) on dynamic data inside the loop
