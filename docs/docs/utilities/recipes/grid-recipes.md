# Grid Recipes

Grid recipes offer utility patterns for working with CSS Grid layouts in Etch.


- **auto-grid**: Creates a responsive grid that automatically adjusts the number of columns based on container width and predefined variables. Allows configuration of column count and "aggressiveness" for stacking on narrow screens.

- **variable-grid**: Defines a grid where the minimum item width is configurable, and columns auto-fit as space allows.

- **grid-1** to **grid-12**: Creates a grid with a fixed number of equal-width columns (from 1 up to 12).

- **grid-1-2**, **grid-1-3**, **grid-2-1**, **grid-2-3**, **grid-3-1**, **grid-3-2**: Sets up two-column grids with custom fractional column sizing (e.g., 1:2, 2:3, 3:1, etc.).

- **content-grid**: Provides an advanced grid layout for content sections, with dedicated columns for features, max-width features, gutters, and full background elements. Useful for complex page layouts with side features or full-bleed backgrounds.
