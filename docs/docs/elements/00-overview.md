# Elements

Elements are the fundamental building blocks of web pages in Etch. These are simple, static elements like headings, paragraphs, containers, and links that form the foundation of your page structure. Unlike [Components (Native)](../components-native/overview) which provide interactive functionality, elements focus on content structure and presentation.

import CategoryOverview from '@site/src/components/CategoryOverview';

<CategoryOverview categoryPath="elements" title="Available Elements" />
