# Accordion

:::note
This page documents the recommended way to add an Accordion by importing the prebuilt component with Copy/Paste JSON below.
:::

## Setup

- Add a container or a flex-div on your site if you don’t already have one.
- You’ll paste the Accordion component into the container or flex-div in the next step.

## Importing the Component

Use the button below to copy the ready-to-use Accordion component as JSON.
Then, in Etch, press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Windows) anywhere in the builder to insert the component.

<div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "1rem", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <CopyToClipboard label="Copy Accordion Component" value={ACCORDION_JSON} />
</div>

### Steps

- Click "Copy Accordion Component" above, then in Etch press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Mac) / <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Windows) anywhere in the builder to insert the component
- Arrange the component inside your container or flex-div.
- Verify the component.

### Configuration

- A `recent_posts` loop should already be in Etch and already wired in the component ( it queries the default post from WordPress ).
- CSS, JS, and props are bundled inside the component—no setup required. You can edit prop values to customize behavior.
- Styling: tweak CSS variables on `.etch-accordion` (e.g., colors, icon sizes).

:::warning
Transition variables:

```css
--etch-accordion-transition-duration
--etch-accordion-transition-timing-function
```
Are used along the CSS but are managed through Props. See [Accordion Component Props](#accordion-component-props) for more details.

## Configuring Your Accordion

You obviously don't want sample data in your Accordion, so let's customize it.

### Loop Configuration

1. Open the Loop Manager.
2. Click on `recent_posts` loop or create a new loop and select the post type you want to query.

### Static Configuration

1. Open the HTML panel and remove the loop.
2. Duplicate the `<div class="etch-accordion__item">`
3. Replace the `{item.title}` and `{item.content}` with another elements or anything you need.

### Accordion Component Props

| Option           | Type                      | Default | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `accordionLoop`        | Loop (array of items)     | preset  | Data source for your accordion. Preinstalled in Etch; edit via Loop Manager. |
| `uniqueId`        | String     | `'acc1'`  | Unique ID for your accordion. This is used to identify the accordion in the DOM and for the accordion's CSS classes. |
| `openFirstItem`        | Boolean     | `true`  | If false, the first accordion item is not opened by default when the accordion is rendered. |
| `allowMultiple`        | Boolean     | `false`  | If true, multiple accordion items can be open at the same time. If false, opening one closes others. |
| `transitionDuration`        | String     | `'0.35s'`  | Duration of the open/close animation (any valid CSS time value, e.g. '0.5s', '200ms'). |
| `transitionTimingFunction`        | String     | `'ease-in-out'`  | The CSS timing function used for accordion panel transitions (e.g., 'ease', 'linear', 'ease-in-out'). |
