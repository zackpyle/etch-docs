# Usage

You connect Etch to your AI agent from chat. There's nothing to install — you paste one command into your AI agent and click a button in the builder.

## 1. Turn on the AI Connector (once)

Connecting relies on Etch's **AI Connector** feature, which is off by default. In the Etch builder, open **Settings**, go to the **AI** section, and turn on **AI Connector** (it's experimental). This adds the connect button you'll use in step 3. You only need to do this once — it stays on.

## 2. Open the page in the Etch builder

Open the page or template you want to work on **in the Etch builder**, and leave that tab open while you work. The builder itself has to be on screen — editing a page or template in Etch — not just your WordPress dashboard, the front end of your site, or the standard block editor.

## 3. Connect

1. In the Etch builder toolbar, click the **AI sparkles** button (its tooltip reads _"Connect external AI agent"_). The button is waiting for the connector to start — it won't light up yet.

2. In your AI agent’s chat (Claude Code, Codex, Opencode, or similar), paste and send:

   ```bash
   npx @digital-gravy/etch-connector serve
   ```

   Your agent runs this for you — you don't need a separate terminal or a global install.

3. Once the agent confirms the connection, the sparkles button in the builder lights up. You're linked — describe what you want in chat ("add a hero section to the homepage", "create a card component", …) and the agent builds it in your open tab.

Click the sparkles button again any time to disconnect.

## Multi-Agent & Maintaining Connection

The connection stays alive as long as the chat where you ran `npx @digital-gravy/etch-connector serve` is still open. You can start as many new chats as you want and keep working through the same connection — there's no need to re-run the command each time. You only need to run it again if you close the original chat, which ends the connection.

The connection also lives in your open builder tab. Don't close or navigate away from the Etch builder tab — that ends the connection.

You can work on multiple sites at the same time — connect a builder tab on each site and the agent can switch between them. Do not connect multiple builder tabs on the same site. Stick to one connected tab per site.

## Troubleshooting

### The connect button isn't in the toolbar

The button only appears when the **AI Connector** setting is on. In the builder, open **Settings → AI** and turn on **AI Connector**, then look for the AI sparkles button in the toolbar.

### It worked before, but a chat can't reach Etch

The connection is tied to the chat where you first ran the command. If you **closed that original chat**, the connection ended — run `npx @digital-gravy/etch-connector serve` again in a chat to restart it. As long as the original chat is still open, any new chat can use the connection without re-running the command. If the sparkles button is still lit in the builder, you don't need to click it again.
