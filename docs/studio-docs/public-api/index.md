# Public API

Etch exposes a typed scripting API on `window.etch` that lets your own scripts and plugins read and mutate the document the builder is editing — blocks, styles, loops, components, custom fields, and the builder UI itself. Every mutation routes through the same guarded paths as the UI, so undo/redo keeps working and nothing bypasses validation.

The contract is published as an MIT-licensed npm package that ships **types plus a thin accessor** — no heavy runtime is bundled. The runtime itself is provided by the Etch builder on the page.

```bash
npm install @digital-gravy/etch-public-api
```

:::warning Experimental surface
The current contract version is **`0.x`** — the surface is experimental and may change without a major version bump until it stabilizes. Prefer [feature detection](#feature-detection) over version comparison, and don't pin production plugins to `0.x`.
:::

## Acquiring the API

Two functions get you a typed handle on the API:

```ts
getEtch(options?: ConnectOptions): Etch
isEtchAvailable(): boolean
```

| Function            | Returns   | Notes                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isEtchAvailable()` | `boolean` | `true` when `window.etch` is present. Use it to guard code that should no-op outside the builder.         |
| `getEtch(options?)` | `Etch`    | Returns the typed API. **Throws** `EtchApiError` with code `NOT_AVAILABLE` when the builder isn't loaded. |

```ts
import { getEtch, isEtchAvailable } from "@digital-gravy/etch-public-api";

function run() {
  if (!isEtchAvailable()) return; // not running inside the Etch builder
  const etch = getEtch();
  const textIds = etch.blocks.find({ type: "etch/text" });
  etch.blocks.setText(textIds[0], "Hello world");
}
```

### Waiting for Etch to load

`window.etch` is injected by the builder during page load. If your script can run before the builder finishes initializing, poll for availability:

```ts
async function whenEtchReady(timeoutMs = 10_000) {
  const start = Date.now();
  while (!isEtchAvailable()) {
    if (Date.now() - start > timeoutMs) throw new Error("Etch did not load");
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  }
  return getEtch();
}

const etch = await whenEtchReady();
```

### ConnectOptions

```ts
interface ConnectOptions {
  apiVersion?: string; // e.g. "^1.0" — reserved for the future 1.x runtime
  id?: string; // your plugin identifier, for telemetry
}
```

On today's `0.x` runtime, `getEtch()` returns the global directly after a best-effort version check (it **warns**, but does not throw, on a major-version mismatch). When a future stable runtime exposes a native `connect()`, version negotiation is delegated to it.

```ts
const etch = getEtch({ apiVersion: "^1.0", id: "my-plugin" });
```

## The `Etch` object

`getEtch()` returns the root `Etch` interface — eleven namespaces plus a few top-level members:

```ts
interface Etch {
  blocks: EtchBlocksApi;
  loops: EtchLoopsApi;
  styles: EtchStylesApi;
  stylesheets: EtchStylesheetsApi;
  components: EtchComponentsApi;
  navigation: EtchNavigationApi;
  fields: EtchFieldsApi;
  ui: EtchUiApi;
  history: EtchHistoryApi;
  skills: EtchSkillsApi;
  ai: EtchAiApi;

  saveAsync(): Promise<void>;
  connect?(options?: ConnectOptions): Etch; // reserved for the future stable runtime
  readonly apiVersion: string; // scripting contract version, e.g. "0.x"
  readonly version: string; // Etch product version
  readonly environment?: EtchEnvironment; // what this runtime is and backs
}
```

| Namespace                  | Page                                    | What it covers                                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Saving and the persistence model

How a change reaches the database depends on which namespace it lives in:

- **`blocks`, `styles`, `loops`** — buffered in the editor. They are persisted when you call `etch.saveAsync()` (the same save the UI performs).
- **`stylesheets`, `components`, `fields`** — every mutating method is `*Async` and **persists immediately**; you do not need `saveAsync()` for them.

```ts
etch.blocks.setText(id, "Hello world");
etch.blocks.addClass(id, "lead");
await etch.saveAsync(); // persists the block changes above
```

## Error handling

Every API error is an `EtchApiError` carrying a machine-readable `code`. Use the `isEtchApiError` type guard to narrow caught values:

```ts
import { isEtchApiError } from "@digital-gravy/etch-public-api";

try {
  etch.blocks.getJson("does-not-exist");
} catch (err) {
  if (isEtchApiError(err)) {
    console.warn(err.code, err.message); // e.g. "BLOCK_NOT_FOUND"
  }
}
```

```ts
class EtchApiError extends Error {
  readonly code: EtchApiErrorCode;
  name: "EtchApiError";
  constructor(code: EtchApiErrorCode, message: string);
}

type EtchApiErrorCode =
  | "BLOCK_NOT_FOUND"
  | "WRONG_BLOCK_TYPE"
  | "READONLY"
  | "INVALID_ARGUMENT"
  | "LOOP_NOT_FOUND"
  | "STYLE_NOT_FOUND"
  | "STYLESHEET_NOT_FOUND"
  | "COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND"
  | "POST_NOT_FOUND"
  | "OPERATION_FAILED"
  | "NOT_AVAILABLE"
  | (string & {}); // open-ended for forward compatibility
```

## Feature detection

<VersionBadge version="1.6.7" />

Because the surface is experimental — and because a namespace can be declared but not backed on the runtime you happen to be on, in which case its methods throw `EtchApiError` with code `NOT_AVAILABLE` — detect features rather than comparing version strings.

`etch.environment` (contract `@digital-gravy/etch-public-api` 0.10.0) describes the runtime your script is actually running against:

```ts
interface EtchEnvironment {
  readonly product: EtchProduct; // which build this is — identity only
  readonly capabilities: EtchCapabilities; // which optional surfaces it backs
  readonly blockTypes: readonly string[]; // every block type it can construct
}

type EtchCapabilities = Readonly<Partial<Record<EtchCapability, boolean>>>;
```

**Branch on a capability, never on `product`.** `product` is identity, for display and diagnostics; capabilities move over time, and a product check silently rots the day they do.

| Capability  | Backed when                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loops`     | [`etch.loops`](./loops.md) is a real registry of loop definitions      |
| `fields`    | [`etch.fields`](./fields.md) is backed by a real field store           |
| `templates` | Template posts exist and `navigation.goTo("templates")` works          |
| `wpMedia`   | Media ids resolve against the WordPress media library (`/wp/v2/media`) |

Every key is optional on purpose: a runtime older than a capability's introduction simply omits it, so **absent means unavailable** — test with `=== true` rather than truthiness.

```ts
const etch = getEtch();

if (etch.environment?.capabilities.fields === true) {
  const groups = await etch.fields.listGroupsAsync();
}
```

`blockTypes` is read live off the runtime's block registry, so it cannot drift from what the runtime can actually construct. Check it instead of assuming a block type exists:

```ts
if (etch.environment?.blockTypes.includes("etch/passthrough")) {
  // safe to author one here
}
```

`environment` itself is optional: a runtime that predates the descriptor omits it. Treat a missing `environment` as everything being available, which is what every runtime that predates it was.

For an individual method that may not exist on an older runtime, `typeof` still applies:

```ts
if (typeof etch.blocks.someNewMethod === "function") {
  // safe to use
}
```

## Module exports

```ts
// Runtime
export { getEtch, isEtchAvailable } from "@digital-gravy/etch-public-api";
export { EtchApiError, isEtchApiError } from "@digital-gravy/etch-public-api";
export { ETCH_API_VERSION } from "@digital-gravy/etch-public-api"; // "0.x"

// Types (all contract interfaces, unions, and the Etch root)
export type {
  Etch,
  ConnectOptions,
  EtchApiErrorCode /* …and the rest */,
} from "@digital-gravy/etch-public-api";
```

| Export                      | Kind     | Description                                         |
| --------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `getEtch`                   | function | Acquire the API from `window.etch`                  |
| `isEtchAvailable`           | function | Check whether the API is present                    |
| `isEtchApiError`            | function | Type guard for `EtchApiError`                       |
| `EtchApiError`              | class    | Typed error with a `code` property                  |
| `ETCH_API_VERSION`          | const    | `"0.x"` — the contract version this package targets |
| `Etch` + all contract types | type     | The root interface plus every namespace/type        |
